    <h1>Welcome to the class roster exercise!</h1>
    <p>For this exercise you will be making a very simple web app that contains an array of student names in a .js file. The website will prompt you for four possible commands:<strong>add, remove, display</strong> and <strong>quit.</strong> This web page will prompt the user for one of the commands. Here is what each command should do: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>add:</strong> will then create a prompt for a student name request. Then add this name to the student to the array of student names in the .js file</li>
      <li><strong>remove:</strong> will create a prompt for a student name request. Then remove this name from the roster array</li>
      <li><strong>display:</strong> will print out the roster using console.log</li>
      <li><strong>quit:</strong> will end the while loop of prompts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Watch the lecture video for an example of how it should work. Also make sure to change the script src file to your own .js file!</p>``
